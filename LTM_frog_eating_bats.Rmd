**Note: in the data, groups have different names than we used in the paper
trained = experienced bats
control = naive bats

primary = trained ringtone (A and B)
control = extinguished ringtone (E)
static = control sound

There are also a number of bats we don't include in the final dataset, bc they have all kinds of different experiences. 
LTM.partial = bats I trained to both A and B for another experiment, never taught to discriminate (never heard E or other call they didn't get rewarded for), released and recaught
control.partial = control bats tested in preliminary trials, before we added the control sound/ static stimulus. They were played A, B, and the extinguished sound (confusingly, "control" in this dataset)

random.experience = oddball bats, with various histories in various experiments. Hard to interpret, have been trained to different things over different periods of times. Interesting anecdotes perhaps.

###Comparison: If we conservatively calculate "primary" as naive bat's highest score to either A or B, rather than their mean score, does that change the results?
